**🔐 Caesar Cipher**

A simple encryption and decryption tool based on the Caesar Cipher technique — one of the oldest known encryption methods. This program shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

**🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?**
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places (key) down or up the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 3:

A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on.

**🎯 Features**
Encrypt any text using a shift key
Decrypt ciphered text with the same key
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
Ignores non-alphabet characters (like punctuation and spaces)

****Console-based Input/Output****
**🚀 How to Use**
Run the program.
Enter a message and a shift value (key).
Choose to encrypt or decrypt.
View the result!

**📁 How to Run (For Python Example)**
python caesar_cipher.py
Or for C:

gcc caesar_cipher.c -o caesar
./caesar

**💡 Example**
Enter text: HELLO
Enter shift: 3
Encrypted text: KHOOR
